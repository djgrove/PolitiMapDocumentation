% \section{Revision History}
\subsection{Background}
Voter turnout is a problem for the United States as a whole, with a
study from Pew Research stating that the US ranks “31st among the 35
countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, most of whose members are highly developed, democratic
states.”  \cite{pew} Voter turnout for local elections in large cities
is even worse, with a 2014 study from Governing showing that turnout
in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and LA ranged from 20\% to 42\% in
the most recent election shown in the study. \cite{governing} Turnout
in San Luis Obispo county for the most recent general election in 2014
was 58.42\% of registered voters. \cite{slocounty}

Since 62,434 registered voters in San Luis Obispo County alone did not vote in the most recent
general election, there is a unique opportunity to significantly increase
voter turnout in the region. Further, it is unlikely these same prospective voters are following local legislation that has been proposed. PolitiMap aims to increase the local political participation by simplifying the political process

  Assumption    & Description \\
  \midrule
  \textbf{AS-1} & More involvement with local politics is beneficial \\

  Dependency    & Description \\
  \midrule
  \textbf{DE-1} &
  Ability to get data on bills in a machine-parsable format (even if
  that is initially plaintext with custom code to parse it) \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabu}

\subsection{Scope}
Initially, the application will only provide a way of viewing current
bills in the San Luis Obispo City Council. Following a successful initial release, the next releases would be expected to add the ability to display current bills in the San Luis
Obispo County Supervisors, followed by the California State
Legislature and the US Congress. Push notifications would be added to
notify people when a new bill comes up. Further expansion to cover more geographical locations would be possible.

\subsection{Limitations and Exclusions}
We have not yet implemented any functionality regarding candidates in
elections in the first versions of the application. Such a feature
might be possible in the long term, but not within the first few
releases.
