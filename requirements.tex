% \subsubsection{Purpose}
% This Software Requirements Specification describes the functional and
% nonfunctional software requirements for an application that brings
% local, regional and national political information to a user's mobile
% device.  This document is intended to be used by the members of the
% project team who will implement and verify the correct functionality
% of the system. This document will also be viewed by our professor,
% Dr. Clark Turner.

% I don't think we have any owners or customers besides ourselves
% right now --AG
% I am including some information about our targeted customer
% archetype for now. This is supposed to be intended audience, not
% active audience. --DG
\subsection{User Segment}
The user segment served by this project is the citizen and legislator population of
the City of San Luis Obispo, California. Within this user segment
exists two primary demographics: a user base between the ages of 35 and 50
(middle-aged), and a user base between the ages of 18 and 22 (college students
at California Polytechnic State University.
\subsection{Use Cases}
% Customers will observe and confirm that the specified features and
% requirements meet business needs and that all user needs are brought
% to attention. Additionally, they will serve as the primary product
% owner as they will prioritize features during implementation.

% \subsection{Project Scope}
% Initially, the application's only function will be to view current
% bills in the San Luis Obispo City Council.
% 
% Following a successful initial release, following releases are
% expected to add the ability to display current bills in the San Luis
% Obispo County Supervisors, followed by the California State
% Legislature and the US Congress. Push notifications will be added to
% notify users when a new bill is introduced. Further expansion to
% cover more geographical locations would be possible.

% \subsection{Overall Description}
% \subsubsection{Product Perspective}
% The application will provide local, regional and national political
% information based on the address provided by the user. The information
% will be displayed in an uncluttered, readable, and simple format.
% User-preferred locations will be able to be saved, edited, and deleted.
% 
% At this stage, we have not explored revenue streams for our business
% model besides advertising. At present, allowing user access for free
% reduces our obligation to users, avoiding some of the potential
% consequences of a major service outage. We do not anticipate server
% load to be unbearable, as we expect PolitiMap to be accessed only once
% or twice a day per user.

\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The initial version of the mobile application will be ported to
the iPhone App Store only, as it will be written in Swift.
\item The initial backend data will exist as static JSON files
  served from a web server.
\end{enumerate}
