\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification describes the functional and nonfunctional software requirements for a research and development release of an unmanned aerial vehicle sense and avoid system. This document is intended to be used by the members of the project team who will implement and verify the correct functionality of the system. This document will also be used by our mentor, Dick Jay, and our direct supervisor, Dr. David Janzen.

\subsection{Document Conventions}
The following conventions are used in our document:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Links appear in a monospaced font.
\item GA-ASI the abbreviation for General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc.
\item A byte refers to eight bits rather than the number of bits used to encode a single character of text on a central processing unit.
\item A float is understood as a floating point number of eight bytes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}

\subsection{Project Scope}
This project will help further GA-ASI in their research and development of a sense and avoid system for unmanned aerial vehicles. Most modern aircraft currently have at least three different surveillance devices that each provide different types of data to its pilots. As the data can often conflict, the goal of this project is to design a system that will combine data from multiple devices: ADS-B, TCAS, and Radar in real time. The aggregated data will be presented on a visual display so that pilots or flight computers can avoid local objects. For additional information on the scope of this project, refer to the project Vision and Scope document listed as a reference.

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
The sense and avoid engine is being designed as an add-on to the on board flight computer of unmanned aerial vehicles. The system will be connected to the TCAS, ADS-B, Radar, and ownship sensors already on board to gather data. In addition, it will output to either the autopilot or to a connected ground control station.\newline

\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{system.png}\\

\subsection{Product Features}

\subsubsection{Surveillance Data Simulation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate ADS-B data
\item Generate TCAS data
\item Generate Radar data
\item Generate ownship data
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Surveillance Data Aggregation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read ADS-B data.
\item Read TCAS data.
\item Read Radar data.
\item Read ownship data.
\item Aggregate surveillance data from multiple sources.
\item Categorize detected objects by threat level.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cockpit Display of Traffic Information}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Display aggregated surveillance data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
\begin{longtable}{|l|p{3.8in}|}
\hline
\textbf{User Class}&\textbf{Description}\\
\hline
Pilot & Monitors aircraft activity using the cockpit display of traffic information. The pilot will not be able to modify the display beyond interacting with easy to use buttons and switches.\\
\hline
Installer & Installs the sense and avoid system and performs initial configuration of the interface with the flight computer.\\
\hline
Engineer & Reviews flight logs and writes analyses and performance reviews. More specifically, engineers will be interested in reviewing the accuracy of the sense and avoid aggregation algorithm.\\
\hline
Administrator & Manages, delegates tasks, and assumes responsibility for running of the sense and avoid system.\\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
The Sense and Avoid Engine is ultimately intended to run on an embedded system contained within the electronics onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle. The software engine will run on a distribution of the Linux operating system. The application will have a dedicated processor and need not coexist with other software components.

\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The sense and avoid processing must be single threaded.
\item The sense and avoid processing occurs once per second.
\item Different surveillance devices have difference levels of data accuracy and rates of object detection.
\item ADS-B and TCAS will only report surveillance data for cooperative aircraft.
\item Radar reports data independently of intruder cooperativeness
\item The sense and avoid system is preferable written in C or C++ as these languages are industry standard.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Documentation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item All executables will be delivered with a README file containing compilation instructions, execution instructions, and usage examples.
\item Any application programming interface documents for stand-alone components that may be reused in later research efforts.
\item Any test files used in the research and development of the sense and avoid processor.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Research and development of an effective sense and avoid algorithm will require real and or simulated surveillance device data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Software Development activities will depend on the proper functioning of all technologies listed in the project Development and Build Environment with Continuous Integration document listed in the References section.
\item Design decisions may be limited by the dependence on the common data protocol shared by all research teams.
\item Any technologies used may later need to be used in the research and development of real unmanned aerial vehicles.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item Br-1: If a plane is within 0.5 nautical miles and 50 feet of elevation of the ownship and the closest point of approach is less than 0.2 nautical miles and less than 5 seconds from the ownship, then the plane will crash.
\item Br-2: If a plane is within 2 nautical miles and 300 feet of elevation of the ownship and the closest point of approach is less than 0.5 nautical miles and less than 30 seconds from the ownship, then the plane will have a Resolution Advisory traffic type.
\item Br-3: If a plane is within 5 nautical miles and 500 feet of elevation of the ownship and the closest point of approach is less than 1 nautical mile and less than 60 seconds from the ownship, then the plane will have a Traffic Advisory traffic type.
\item Br-4: If a plane is within 10 nautical miles and 1000 feet of the ownship, then the plane will have a Proximate Traffic traffic type.
\end{itemize}
