\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification describes the functional and nonfunctional software requirements for an application that brings local, regional and national political information to a user's mobile device.  This document is intended to be used by the members of the project team who will implement and verify the correct functionality of the system. This document will also be seen by our professor, Dr. Clark Turner.

\subsection{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}

\subsubsection{Software Development Engineers}
Developers will primarily reference the functional and nonfunctional requirements. These requirements correspond to the features to be implemented. For the purposes of implementation, it may also be helpful to reference use cases.

\paragraph{Suggested Reading Sequence:}
\begin{compactenum}
\item Overall Description
\item System Features
\item Use Cases
\item External Interface Requirements
\item Other Nonfunctional Requirements
\end{compactenum}

% I don't think we have any owners or customers right now --AG
\subsubsection{Software Product Owners and Customers}
Currently the developers are acting as customers, as they are members of the initial user class (i.e., young residents of San Luis Obispo).
%Customers will observe and confirm that the specified features and requirements meet business needs and that all user needs are brought to attention. Additionally, they will serve as the primary product owner as they will prioritize features during implementation.

%\end{compactenum}

\subsection{Project Scope}
Initially, the application will only provide a way of viewing current bills in the San Luis Obispo City Council.

Following a successful initial release, the next releases would be expected to add the ability to display current bills in the San Luis Obispo County Supervisors, followed by the California State Legislature and the US Congress. Push notifications would be added to notify people when a new bill is introduced. Further expansion to cover more geographical locations would be possible.

\end{compactenum}

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
The application will provide local, regional and national political information based inputed and saved addresses the user provides. The information will be displayed in a clean, readable and simple format. User prefered locations will be saved, editited and deleted.

\subsection{Product Features}

\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
\begin{longtable}{|l|p{3.8in}|}
\hline
\textbf{User Class}&\textbf{Description}\\
\hline
Local Voters & Will be able to see policies that affect their everyday life as well as when said policies will be up for vote. Also can see different levels of policies.\\
\hline
Local activist groups & Make bills affecting their causes more widely known. Finding and supporting political figures that support their position.\\
\hline
Local government officials & Will recieve more calls from voters if the application succeeds. Not direct user of the application but directly affected by popularity of the application.\\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
This project will be run as an iPhone mobile application aimed at users across the United States. Since our initial target audience is limited to a domestic one, the geographic distribution wonâ€™t be such that servers at many unique locations will be necessary. Instead the application will request relevent information using Rest API calls to a backend that provides the information in simple JSON files. 

All information will be stored in JSON files since the data is static and is read only. Until the application scales to a much higher level and evolves into an interactive one, the need for setting up a secure database is unnecessary and is a waste of resources. For the scope of our project we have decided to set up the backend enviroment to meet the specifications and requirements in this way.

At this stage, we have not explored revenue streams for our business model besides advertising. At present, allowing user access for free somewhat reduces the risk incurred by a major service outage on our app since the degree of pressure involved when users pay for access to the application is significant. PolitiMap is not a tool we expect to be used more than once or twice a day by customers.

\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The application will be written in swift and thus initially only useable by users with a iPhone.
\item The backend with be written in ruby and will be accessebile to any front end with rest API calls.
\item The data is stored in JSON making front end to back end data transfer quick with no need for database access.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Documentation}
TBD
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item More involvement with local politics is benecial
\item Voters lack information in order to be more involved with local politics
\item Voter involvement with local politics is limited
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ability to get data on bills in a machine-parsable format (even if that is initially plaintext with custom code to parse it)
\end{enumerate}

\section{System Features}

\subsection{Data Transmission}
\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
All data read by the application must be in the same format no matter the location. Data format must be standard at each locational level, local, regional or national. Data must be available to the system everytime a call is made.
\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
\begin{longtable}{|r|p{3.8in}|}
\hline
Stimulus & Once a location has been provided and the user has accesesed it the application will make a rest API call through the back end framework.\\
\hline
Response & The system will provide the correct data in the correct JSON format with a response to the Rest API call.\\
\hline
\end{longtable}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{longtable}{|r|p{3.8in}|}
\hline
FR Requirement & Description \\
\hline
FR-1 & The system shall load data in the JSON format specied in an appendix. \\
\hline
FR-2 & The system shall fetch the data using AJAX or other method of web request. \\
\hline
FR-3 & The system shall only load JSON data for the locations
selected by the user. \\
\hline
FR-4 &The system shall data on politicians must be veriable and
completely accurate.\\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Data editing}
\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
The user information is under the users full controll. The user should be able to add, edit and delete any user information. This is a big feature as in building an application for transparency. Users should feel in control. Users will not be able to edit requested data from saved locations, only the locations addresses themselves.
\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
\begin{longtable}{|r|p{3.8in}|}
\hline
Stimulus & User choses to edit address. \\
\hline
Response & Option to change address or delete it completely from the application. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{longtable}{|r|p{3.8in}|}
\hline
FR Requirement & Description \\
\hline
FR-5 & The system should allow user locations to readable and writeable only locally. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Data Logging}
\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
The system will store locally on the application the saved and preffered locations in the correct JSON format. They information stored will only be that off the address of the location. The information stored can be manipulated by the user.
\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
\begin{longtable}{|r|p{3.8in}|}
\hline
Stimulus & The application is on the home page and the user searches for a new address. \\
\hline
Response & The application verifies location and stores the new information. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{longtable}{|r|p{3.8in}|}
\hline
FR Requirement & Description \\
\hline
FR-6 & The system should have a place for stored user locations. \\
FR-7 & The system should be able to read and write new data to the file according to the user preference. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}
